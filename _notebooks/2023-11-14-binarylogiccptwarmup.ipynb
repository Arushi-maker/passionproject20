    "## Binary Code\n",
    "< Binary code is a system of representing information using only two digits: 0 and 1.\n",
    "- It is the fundamental language of computers, which use electronic circuits to store and process data.\n",
    "- In binary code, each digit is called a \"bit,\" and a group of 8 bits is known as a \"byte.\"\n",
    "- Binary code is the foundation of all computer languages and is used to encode text, numbers, and other data types.\n",
    "- It relies on the binary system, which is based on powers of 2, with each digit representing a power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.).\n",
    "- The combination of 0s and 1s in various sequences allows computers to represent and process a wide range of information.'''"
