    "The goal is to create an application where any user can come and get a preliminary diagnosis while also having a safe space to indulge in mental health awareness. Our application centers around a personal questionaire, inkblot tests, and various exams to find the perfect evaluation for their needs. Our team believes in agile working to complete this task. We hope to make this a reliable and open source to several kinds of people from all demographics, who want instantaneous results.\n",
